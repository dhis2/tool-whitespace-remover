# Whitespace Cleaner Tool
Tool to remove trailing, leading and double white space in metadata (name, shortName, description, code properties).

> **WARNING**
> This tool is intended to be used by system administrators to perform specific tasks, it is not intended for end users. It is available as a DHIS2 app, but has not been through the same rigorous testing as normal core apps. It should be used with care, and always tested in a development environment.

## Getting started

### Install dependencies
To install app dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

### Compile to zip
To compile the app to a .zip file that can be installed in DHIS2:

```
yarn run zip
```

### Start dev server
To start the webpack development server:

```
yarn start
```

By default, webpack will start on port 8081, and assumes DHIS2 is running on 
http://localhost:8080/dhis with `admin:district` as the user and password.

A different DHIS2 instance can be used to develop against by adding a `d2auth.json` file like this:

```
{
    "baseUrl": "http://localhost:9000/dev",
    "username": "john_doe",
    "password": "District1!"
}
```
